# CarletonScheduler

This project has the ability to compile a list of every course offered at Carleton in the upcoming semesters as well as their scheduled time.

In the future, the goal is to automatically create a course sequence generator for students pursuing certain degrees.

Another possible ability is to create combinations of courses available for a current semester to avoid overlapping classes.
